## Roadmap

There are a few things that would be super cool to have. I'd be very
appreciative if you'd like to contribute to it. Here are some ideas:

- Ability to save selectors with searchable name
- Ability to save selectors & source
- Import source from gists
- Import source from github repos
- JSL integration
- rewrite-js integration
- Better generation of colors
- ~~Live-update colored source code on selector change~~
- Clicking source code element should suggest selectors to use.
